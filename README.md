# DebugItSAMRIDDHI 
This is Samriddhi, 1st yearite from Chemical Engineering (IIT BHU)
This is my solution to DebugIt(COPS WEEK 2025 competition) on PS-3(Mobility and Traffic Management)
I've built a FrontEnd website which is a solution to improve traffic flow and make roads safer.
`index.html` --> This is the main file that loads first when the website opens.
Various other files open when user clicks on buttons for different features.
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Leaflet.js for maps.
